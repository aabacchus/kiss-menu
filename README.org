* kiss-menu

An Emacs major mode to view and manage lists of KISS packages.
Uses [[https://github.com/ehawkvu/kiss.el][kiss.el]].

** Setup

I'm not totally sure how to do this properly.
Download this file to the directory =/path/to/kiss-menu/=, then
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/kiss-menu/")
  (require 'kiss-menu)
#+END_SRC
should work. Then you might like to add a keybinding, for example:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c k") #'kiss-menu)
#+END_SRC


** TODO
- package buttons go to details: version, path, manifest, size etc
- add helper functions to build, install, etc packages (marked or individually)
- mark for specific task then execute?
- package search in repos
- keymap doesn't work with evil-mode
